  # Prefetching is necessary to use @property_hash inside any setter methods.
  # self.prefetch uses self.instances to gather an array of user instances
  # on the system, and then populates the @property_hash instance variable
  # with attribute data for the specific instance in question (i.e. it
  # gathers the 'is' values of the resource into the @property_hash instance
  # variable so you don't have to read from the system every time you need
  # to gather the 'is' values for a resource. The downside here is that
  # populating this instance variable for every resource on the system
  # takes time and front-loads your Puppet run.

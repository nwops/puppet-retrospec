Puppet::Functions.create_function(<%= name.to_sym.inspect %>) do
  # the function below is called by puppet and and must match
  # the name of the puppet function above. You can set your
  # required parameters below and puppet 4 will enforce these
  # change x and y to suit your needs although only one parameter is required
  def <%= name %>(x,y)
    x >= y ? x : y
  end

  # you can define other helper methods in this code block as well
